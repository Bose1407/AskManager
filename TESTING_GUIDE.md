# ✅ Google OAuth Login is Ready!

## 🎯 Current Status

✅ **MongoDB Connected** - Database is working
✅ **Server Running** - On port 8081
✅ **Login Page** - Created with Google OAuth button
✅ **Signup Page** - Created with Google OAuth button
✅ **Home Page** - Auto-redirects to login if not authenticated

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Update Google OAuth First!

**Your server is on port 8081, not 8080!**

### Go to Google Cloud Console:
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

### Update These URLs:

**Authorised JavaScript origins:**
```
http://localhost:8081
```

**Authorised redirect URIs:**
```
http://localhost:8081/api/auth/google/callback
```

**Click SAVE and wait 1-2 minutes!**

## 🧪 Test Your Login

http://localhost:8081/login
```

- ✅ Green gradient background

- ✅ "Continue with Google" button with Google logo

### 3. Click "Continue with Google"

## 🔗 All Available Routes

```
✅ http://localhost:8081/           → Redirects to /login (if not logged in)
✅ http://localhost:8081/login      → Login with Google
✅ http://localhost:8081/signup     → Signup with Google  
✅ http://localhost:8081/dashboard  → Protected (need to login first)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "redirect_uri_mismatch" Error
- Update Google Console URLs to use port **8081**
- Make sure redirect URI is: `http://localhost:8081/api/auth/google/callback`
- Wait 1-2 minutes after saving

### Login button doesn't work
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Make sure server is running (`pnpm dev`)
- Check MongoDB connection in terminal

### Can't access dashboard
- After login, your role is `employee` by default
- Dashboard requires `manager` or `admin` role
- Update your role in MongoDB:
  1. Go to MongoDB Atlas
  2. Browse Collections → users
  3. Find your user
  4. Edit `role` field to `"manager"`

---

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You know it's working when:
1. ✅ Login page loads at `/login`
2. ✅ Google button redirects to Google
3. ✅ After Google login, you're redirected back
4. ✅ User is created in MongoDB `users` collection
5. ✅ Terminal shows: "✅ MongoDB connected successfully"

## 📱 Next Steps After Login

1. **Update Your Role**
   - Go to MongoDB Atlas
   - Change your role from `employee` to `manager`
   - Refresh the page

2. **Access Dashboard**
