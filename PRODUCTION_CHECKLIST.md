## üîß IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED

### 1. Environment Variables
**Current Issues**:
- Using hardcoded fallbacks
- No email configuration
- No file storage configuration

**Fix**: Create comprehensive `.env` file:
```env
# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/company-manager

# Session
SESSION_SECRET=generate-a-long-random-string-here-at-least-32-chars

# OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Email (Nodemailer)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-company@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM="Company Name <noreply@company.com>"

# File Upload (Cloudinary)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret

# Frontend
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Optional
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
```

### 2. Database Indexes
**Add these to improve performance**:

```typescript
// In server/models/User.ts
userSchema.index({ email: 1 });
userSchema.index({ role: 1 });

// In server/models/Task.ts
taskSchema.index({ status: 1, assignedTo: 1 });
taskSchema.index({ createdAt: -1 });

// In server/models/Message.ts
messageSchema.index({ createdAt: -1 });
messageSchema.index({ isPinned: 1 });

// In server/models/Leave.ts
leaveSchema.index({ employeeId: 1, status: 1 });
leaveSchema.index({ startDate: 1, endDate: 1 });
```

### 3. Settings Page - Make It Functional
**Current**: Settings don't save
**Fix**: Add API endpoints in `server/routes/auth.ts`:

```typescript
// PATCH /api/auth/profile - Update profile
// PATCH /api/auth/password - Change password
// PATCH /api/auth/preferences - Save notification preferences
```
